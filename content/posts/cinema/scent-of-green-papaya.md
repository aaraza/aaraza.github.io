*Tran Anh Hung's* slice of life shows the world through the eyes of a Vietnamese peasant-girl, Mui, growing up in Saigon in 1951. It won the *Caméra d'Or* (best film by new director) at Cannes in 1993 and is the first of five collaborations between him and his wife, *Tran Nu Yen Khe*.

This movie is hidden gem. A slow-burn with exceptional camera-work, its full of contradictions: minimal movements and stillness in the shots highlight the constant motion of everyday life. A story filled with emotionally charged themes like abject poverty, familial abandonment, and unrequited love amongst other things somehow ends up being a relaxing and poignant tale.  

The greatest contradiction is Mui's ability to find beauty and joy in the simplest things in life. A drop of water dripping onto on the leaves outside her window in the morning, or the scent of a green papaya which she so meticulously chops up. It reminded me that happiness comes from within. It has little to do with wealth or what's going on around us. Its a choice we make every day - how to perceive the world and whether to love it or not. 

It's a beautiful movie because it shows life through the eyes of someone who finds the world to be beautiful.
