*Tran Anh Hung's* slice of life shows life through the eyes of a Vietnamese peasant-girl, Mui, growing up in Saigon in 1951. It won the *Caméra d'Or* (best film by new director) at Cannes in 1993 and is the first of five collaborations between him and his wife, *Tran Nu Yen Khe*.

This movie is truly a hidden gem. A slow-burn with some of the best camera work I've seen in any film or show. Mui's ability to find beauty and joy in the simplest things in life, such as a drop of water dripping onto on the leaves outside her window in the morning - or the scent of a green papaya which she so meticulously chops up, reminded us that happiness comes from within. It has little to do with wealth or what's going on around us. Its a choice we make every day becasue we control our attitude towards the world around us regardless of whatever else might be going on. Its a beautiful movie because it shows life through the eyes of someone who finds the world to be beautiful.
