*Tran Anh Hung's* slice of life shows the world through the eyes of a Vietnamese peasant, Mui, as she grows up in Saigon starting in 1951. It won the *Caméra d'Or* (best film by new director) at Cannes in 1993 and is the first of five collaborations between him and his wife, *Tran Nu Yen Khe*.

A slow-burn with exceptional camera-work, this film is a hidden gem defined by its contradictions: the minimal movements and stillness in the shots highlight the constant motion of everyday life. A story filled with emotionally charged themes such as abject poverty, familial abandonment, and unrequited love ends up being a relaxing and poignant tale. 

The greatest contradiction however is Mui's ability to find beauty and joy in the simplest things around her. A drop of water dripping onto the leaves outside her window or the scent of a green papaya which she so meticulously chops up. It reminds us that happiness comes from within and has little to do with wealth or what's going on around us. It's a choice we make every day - how to perceive the world and whether to love it or not. 

This is a beautiful movie because it shows life through the eyes of someone who finds the world to be beautiful.
