- [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com): I especially recommend the computer architecture course
- [A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf): Edgar F. Codd demonstrates formal logic and set theory can be used to ensure data integrity. This paper led to SQL and essentially all modern RDBMSs.
- [Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules](https://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P487.PDF): Seminal research on how to discover associations between transactions in massive datasets.
- [The Hadoop Distributed File System](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/CS838/F15/838-CloudPapers/hdfs.pdf): Storing massive datasets on distributed clusters.
- [Resilient Distributed Datasets](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi12/nsdi12-final138.pdf): The core distributed computing abstraction used in Apache Spark.
