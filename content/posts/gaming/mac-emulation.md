## Setup

#### Atari 2600, NES, SNES, Gameboy, N64, and Sega Genesis
1. Download and install [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org).
2. Download a curated rom set. I used [Tiny Best Set: Go!](https://archive.org/details/tiny-best-set-go).

#### PS2
1. Download and install [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net).
2. Download PS2 [bios](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files#PlayStation_2) and add it to PCSX2.
3. Download roms as needed. I get them from [RomsFun.com](https://romsfun.com/roms/playstation-2/).

You now have more gaming options on your Mac than any arcade ever. As a 90s kid who was mesmerized by endless cartridge walls in gaming shops, its incredible knowing I have all those options at the tip of my fingers.

As an aside, the built in trackpad/keyboard is obviously not optimal. I recommend using a modern gaming controller, either Xbox or Playstation. I had trouble getting an after-market controller (8BitDo Ultimate 2C Controller) to work with Steam on MacOS.

## Thoughts

Microsoft's Windows is the de facto operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It's dominant market share, 70% gloabally, essentially necessitates that developers build for Windows. Apple's macOS is the most successful challenger - it's 15% market share (30% in the US) quadrupled in the 2010s. Apple successfully marketed Macs as the up-scale personal computing upgrade and it become particularly popular amongst college students, creatives, and developers.

While MacOS is inferior to Windows as a purpose built gaming device, it's trivial to transform it into a retro-gaming powerhouse. Rapid technological advancements in both computing and graphcis mean that even blockbuster AAA titles from two generations ago (think PS2 era), are trivial to run on a modern Mac.

A cursory glance at the analysis of gaming platforms and their libraries reveals just how quickly the industry has evolved:
