50 Cent once tried mocking Mayweather by challenging him to read one page of a Harry Potter book for a $750,000 donation to a charity of Floyd's choice. Because of this, people started to assume Mayweather is mentally challenged. In this day and age, baseless rumors spread fast, but this one is particularly absurd becuase Floyd Mayweather is nothing short of a genius.

Starting from Super Featherweight (130lbs) and going all the way up to light middle weight (154lbs), he retired a five division world champion with an undefeated record of 50-0. By all metrics, he is undeniably one of the greatest athletes in a sport that's been around since 1867. 

Amongst idiots, he has a reputation for being a runner, and for not finishing fights. Its important to remember that he ultra conservitive with his punches only after he had repeaeted issues with his hands breaking due to punches. Its quite incredible to adjust to such a debilitating issue in a manner that somehow makes you better. Its no short feat to stand infront of someone like Canelo all night long and beat him to a pulp while he can't touch you. Certainly, there's more beauty in that than watching Wilder smash a can.
