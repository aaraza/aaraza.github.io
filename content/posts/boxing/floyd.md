50 Cent once mocked Floyd Mayweather by challenging him to read a page from Harry Potter for $750,000 with the implication that Mayweather is illiterate. Since then, people started assuming Floyd is mentally challenged, or atleast a bit slow. In this day and age, baseless rumors spread fast. However, this one is particularly absurd becuase Floyd Mayweather is nothing short of a genius.

Starting as a Super Featherweight (130lbs) in back 1996 and going all the way up to light middle weight (154lbs) with his final fight in 2017, Mayweather retired a five division world champion with an undefeated record of 50-0. By all metrics, he is undeniably one of the greatest athletes in a sport that's been around since 1867. 

Amongst idiots, he developed a reputation for being a runner who didn't finish fights. Its important to note he leaned into a defensive style as an adaption to mitigate his weak hands, which would break when he threw too many punches. Its quite incredible to adjust against such a debilitating issue and come out looking better. Its no short feat to stand infront of someone like Canelo all night long and beat him at will while he can't touch you. Certainly, there's more beauty in that than watching Wilder smash cans.
