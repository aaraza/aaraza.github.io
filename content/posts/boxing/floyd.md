Starting as a super featherweight (130lbs) in back 1996 and going all the way up to light middle weight (154lbs) with his final fight in 2017, Mayweather retired a five division world champion with an undefeated record of 50-0. By all metrics, he is undeniably one of the greatest athletes in a sport that's been around since 1867.
