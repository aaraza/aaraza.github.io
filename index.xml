I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based out of Seattle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on many interesting projects such as building machine learning models for user authentication services with over 20 million daily average users and developing ETL pipelines to efficiently process massive medical datasets, helping provide proactive healthcare to entire communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in core computer science topics such as algorithm design, operating systems, computer architecture, and machine learning, as well as software engineering concepts such as distributed systems, containerization, SDLC, and leading engineering teams.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
