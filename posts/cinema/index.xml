&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tran Anh Hung&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; slice of life shows life through the eyes of a Vietnamese peasant-girl, Mui, growing up in Saigon in 1951. It won the &lt;em&gt;Caméra d&amp;rsquo;Or&lt;/em&gt; (best film by new director) at Cannes in 1993 and is the first of five collaborations between him and his wife, &lt;em&gt;Tran Nu Yen Khe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie is truly a hidden gem. A slow-burn with some of the best camera work I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in any film or show. Mui&amp;rsquo;s ability to find beauty and joy in the simplest things in life, such as a drop of water dripping onto on the leaves outside her window in the morning - or the scent of a green papaya which she so meticulously chops up, reminded us that happiness comes from within. It has little to do with wealth or what&amp;rsquo;s going on around us. Its a choice we make every day becasue we control our attitude towards the world around us regardless of whatever else might be going on. Its a beautiful movie because it shows life through the eyes of someone who finds the world to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
