Since then, people started assuming Floyd is mentally challenged, or atleast a bit slow. In this day and age, baseless rumors spread fast. However, this one is particularly absurd becuase Floyd Mayweather is nothing short of a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting as a Super Featherweight (130lbs) in back 1996 and going all the way up to light middle weight (154lbs) with his final fight in 2017, Mayweather retired a five division world champion with an undefeated record of 50-0. By all metrics, he is undeniably one of the greatest athletes in a sport that&amp;rsquo;s been around since 1867.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
